# WhatsApp for Thunderbird

## Introduction

Open WhatsApp in a Thunderbird Tab.

Note that WhatsApp uses user agent to identify what browser is being used, so it won't accept Thunderbird's user agent as a supported browser (even though Thunderbird is essensially Firefox ESR). To work around this, this extension replaces "Thunderbird" in the user agent with "Firefox" when accessing WhatsApp.

## Building

Put everything under this repository into a zip file, and name it as "whatsapp-tb.xpi".
